<p>'Sblood, but you will not hear me: 
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</p>

<p>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, 
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, 
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, 
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place: 
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes, 
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance 
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; 
And, in conclusion, 
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, 
'I have already chose my officer.' 
And what was he? 
Forsooth, a great arithmetician, 
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, 
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; 
That never set a squadron in the field, 
Nor the division of a battle knows 
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, 
Wherein the toged consuls can propose 
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise, 
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election: 
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof 
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds 
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd 
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster, 
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, 
And I - God bless the mark! - his Moorship's ancient.</p>

<p>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, 
Preferment goes by letter and affection, 
And not by old gradation, where each second 
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, 
Whether I in any just term am affined 
To love the Moor.</p>

<p>O, sir, content you; 
I follow him to serve my turn upon him: 
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters 
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark 
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, 
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, 
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, 
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd: 
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are 
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, 
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, 
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, 
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined 
their coats 
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; 
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, 
It is as sure as you are Roderigo, 
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: 
In following him, I follow but myself; 
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, 
But seeming so, for my peculiar end: 
For when my outward action doth demonstrate 
The native act and figure of my heart 
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after 
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve 
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</p>

<p>Call up her father, 
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight, 
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, 
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, 
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, 
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, 
As it may lose some colour.</p>
